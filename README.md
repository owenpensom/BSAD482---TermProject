### **Executive Summary**

The goal and project analyses and evaluates how Canada recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to socioeconomic factors. The key drivers of our analysis will be economic trends, public health, and finally mobility indicators. We will be using trusted statistical organizations to gather our data, from platforms like statistics canada, google mobility reports, and the world bank. The goal of the analysis of this data will allow us to determine common trends, measure progress, and show the similarities and differences of recovery between different geographic regions. We aim to use a combination of statistical analysis and data manipulation/visualization to allow policymakers and stakeholders to have further insights and understanding. Through this approach, we will be able to evaluate and comprehend the long and short term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on canada.

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1. #### **Vaccination Rates**
   * Tracks the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.  
   * Target: Achieve 90% full vaccination coverage across all provinces, the current national average of 85%.  
   * Monthly updates from public health agencies.

2. #### **Mobility Recovery Index**
   * Measures the return to pre-pandemic activity levels across workplaces, retail, and residential organizations/companies.  
   * Target: Reach pre-pandemic mobility levels in all regions.  
   * Weekly updates using Google Mobility Reports.

3. #### **Unemployment Rate Trends**
   * Continuously watching the changes in unemployment rates to evaluate how our economy has recovered.  
   * Target: Reduce unemployment to pre-pandemic levels, the current national unemployment rate is 7.5%.  
   * Monthly reporting from Statistics Canada.

4. #### **Public Health Spending Changes**
   * Evaluating and understanding the provincial-level spending on healthcare during the pandemic and its impact on recovery.  
   * Target: Increase the healthcare spending growth of at least 5% in regions that are not receiving fair resources, the current average growth of 3.8%.  
   * Annual evaluation through provincial budget reports.

5. #### **Economic Recovery Index**
   * Combines Canada‚Äôs GDP growth and unemployment rates and trends to evaluate overall recovery of the economy.  
   * Achieve a GDP growth rate of at least 2.5% annually while maintaining an unemployment rate below 6.5%.  
   * Quarterly assessments using Statistics Canada and the World Bank data.

6. #### **Regional Disparity in Recovery**
