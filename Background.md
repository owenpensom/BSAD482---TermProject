# COVID-19 Recovery Trends and Socioeconomic Impacts

## Problem

Understanding the factors that influence the uneven socioeconomic recovery from COVID-19 across Canadian provinces and cities. Mainly focusing on vaccination rates, mobility trends, unemployment, and public health spending.<br>

## Problem Context

The COVID-19 pandemic caused the world to slow down in every manner, especially the public health sector, economies and the health and well being of the global population. When we look within Canada, the damage was expansive and reached every individual and every industry<mark>(cite)</mark>. The major issues that we experienced as a nation were the healthcare capacity, the rapidly rising numbers of unemployment, and our society recovering from the mental damage of the shutdowns<mark>(cite)</mark>. The socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are still being felt today. The following information will help us understand the key factors and drivers of Canada’s recovery process. <br>

In this study, we dive into and analyze a select set of data that we believe will give us insights on how we are recovering, we are going to examine trends like vaccination rate, mobility pattern, unemployment rates and finally public health spending. Each region of Canada will have differences and variations, we plan on looking at those variations to understand why or why regions didn't recover well from the pandemic. We are planning to use our information, projected patterns and insights to help Canadian policy makers and stakeholders make an educated decision on how to approach their long lasting recovery process. The results drawn from the analysis will help promote and push forward our socioeconomic recovery as well as preparing us for future issues that could have similar impacts as COVID-19<br>

## Significance of the Study

This analysis is critical for the following reasons:<br>

Understanding Recovery Factors: Through understanding these important factors and the key drivers of the recovery, it will help policymakers assign crucial resources effectively.<br>

Addressing Regional Inequalities: Looking at and analyzing the common trends of each region's recovery from COVID-19, making sure we are prepared for if a similar situation arises, as well as making sure nobody is left behind in recovery. <br>

Informing Future Crisis Responses: Using the analysis of the situational effects of the pandemic paired with the data, we will be able to use our findings to guide and influence our decisions in the future if a event like COVID-19 ever happened again.<br>

Evaluating Policy Effectiveness: Future strategies will be refined through looking at the impacts of the government's policies that helped shape the way Canada recovered. <br>

## Research Objectives

1. Look and analyze the connection between vaccination rates and recovery outcomes across the Canadian regions.
2. Analyze the recovery trends, mainly economic, this includes factors like unemployment and GDP growth.
3. Consider the public health spending changes pre and post COVID-19 to see how they impacted recovery outcomes.
4. Compare and contrast the recovery trends across regions and cities to identify where certain places excelled or had a difficult time recovering.
