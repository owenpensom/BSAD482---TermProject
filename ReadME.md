*By: Owen Pensom*
## **Executive Summary**

The study evaluates how Canada recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to socioeconomic factors. The key drivers of our analysis will be economic trends, public health, and finally mobility indicators. We will be using trusted statistical organizations to gather our data, from platforms like statistics canada, google mobility reports, and the world bank. The goal of the analysis of this data will allow us to determine common trends, measure progress, and show the similarities and differences of recovery between different geographic regions. We aim to use a combination of statistical analysis and data manipulation/visualization to allow policymakers and stakeholders to have further insights and understanding. Through this approach, we will be able to evaluate and comprehend the long and short term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on canada.
