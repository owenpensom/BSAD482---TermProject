To explore how different indicators were connected during the COVID-19 recovery, I started by creating a correlation heatmap. One of the strongest relationships I found was between vaccination rates and unemployment — provinces with higher percentages of fully vaccinated people tended to have lower unemployment. But since correlation doesn’t always mean causation, I used a causal inference tool called DoWhy to test if this relationship was actually causal.
In my analysis, the main question was: Does increasing the percentage of people fully vaccinated lead to lower unemployment? I used percent_fully_vaccinated as the treatment variable and Unemployment Rate (%) as the outcome. I also controlled for other factors that could influence both, including Total healthcare spending, Public Health, Administration, and COVID-19 Response Funding. After building a causal graph and running a backdoor-adjusted linear regression, the result showed that a 1% increase in full vaccination leads to a 0.043% decrease in unemployment, on average.
To make sure the result was trustworthy, I ran two refutation tests:
Random Common Cause Refuter: After adding a fake random confounder, the new effect stayed nearly the same (–0.0434), with a p-value of 0.98.


Data Subset Refuter: Even when using a random slice of the data, the effect still held (–0.0436), with a p-value of 0.94.


These results suggest that the relationship between vaccination and unemployment is causal and stable, not just a coincidence or driven by random variation. Overall, the analysis supports the idea that higher full vaccination rates helped reduce unemployment during the pandemic
